            <h3>
                The following is a complete list of all educational institutions in the Girls und Panzer
                Projekt including those details in official spin-offs and supplementary material. All
                schools appearing in the anime are Japanese schools, but many have a motif from another
                foreign WW2 nation. All secondary school institutions are built upon school carriers, huge
                aircraft carrier hulls operated entirely by students, with towns built on the main decks.
                School ships each have a coastal home town where they can put in for servicing. Most school
                ships are also based off of a real life military vessel.

                    Ōarai Girls' Academy (大洗女子学園) is the principal school shown in Girls und Panzer.
                    The school operates assorted World War Two tanks from many nations, including a German
                    Panzerkampfwagen IV, a Czechoslovakian Panzerkampfwagen 38(t) (later converted to a
                    Jagdpanzer 38 (t) Hetzer), a German Sturmgeschutz III Ausf.F, a Japanese Type 89B
                    I-Go, a American M3 Lee, a French Char B1-Bis, a German Tiger (P), a Japanese Type
                    3 Chi-Nu and an English Mark IV. All of the protagonists are students from Ōarai and
                    members of its sensha-dō team, themselves divided into teams with their own respective
                    tanks.

                    Anzio High School (アンツィオ高校) is an Italian-themed school in Girls und Panzer, known
                    for its energetic and carefree students who love food, especially pasta and pizza. Their
                    leader, Anchovy, is a charismatic and passionate commander who motivates her team with fiery
                    speeches. Although Anzio's tanks are not the strongest, their fast and unpredictable tactics
                    make them a challenging opponent. They fight with enthusiasm, relying on mobility and
                    numbers rather than firepower. Their battle against Ōarai Girls' Academy is shown in the
                    OVA This is the Real Anzio Battle!, where their fun and chaotic style shines.

                    The school is also believed to have the third largest tank arsenal, behind Saunders and
                    Kuromorimine.

                    Kuromorimine Girls' Academy (黒森峰女学園), also known as Black Forest Peak Girls' Academy, is
                    one of the schools in Girls und Panzer. The school operates German World War II tanks, some
                    examples of which are the Panzerkampfwagen III Ausf. J, Panther Ausf. G, Tiger I, Tiger II
                    (Königstiger/King Tiger), Jagdtiger, Jagdpanther, Jagdpanzer IVs, Elefant (Ferdinand) and an

                    Chi-Ha-Tan Academy is a Japanese-themed school in Girls und Panzer, known for its reckless
                    and overly enthusiastic battle style. Their students value bravery and charge into battle
                    \fearlessly, often relying on relentless frontal assaults rather than strategic maneuvers.
                    Initially, this led to many defeats, but over time, they learned to balance aggression with
                    smarter tactics. Their tank lineup consists mainly of Japanese World War II tanks, such as
                    the Type 97 Chi-Ha and Type 3 Chi-Nu, which are outmatched by more modern vehicles. Despite
                    their disadvantages, Chi-Ha-Tan’s fighting spirit and determination make them a formidable
                    and respected team.
